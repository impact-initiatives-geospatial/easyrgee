The goal of easyrgee is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of easyrgee from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("impact-initiatives-geospatial/easyrgee")
remotes::install_github("impact-initiatives-geospatial/easyrgee"")
```
## Note

The package contains mainly convenience wrappers for the [rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) package. The [rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) package requires a GEE account.

Much of the functionality of this package is slowly being integrated into the [exploreRGEE](https://github.com/joshualerickson/exploreRGEE) package. 

## Examples

### Zonal stats

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: extracting zonal statistics of an `ee$ImageCollection` and plotting

First we load a few packages, initialize earth engine, and load in an internal data set which contains 3 admin polygons in NE Nigeria.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(easyrgee)
library(rgee)
library(ggplot2)

ee_Initialize(quiet=T)

# 3 admin boundaries in NE NGA
dat<- easyrgee::adm1_ne_nga
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=TRUE}

dat_internal <-  readRDS(here::here("vignettes/dat_internal.rds"))
median_ndvi <- dat_internal$median_ndvi
median_cumulative_rainfall <-  dat_internal$median_cumulative_rainfall
```


Next we load in a MODIS NDVI `ee$ImageCollection` for 2016
```{r, eval=F}

modis_ndvi <- ee$ImageCollection("MODIS/006/MOD13Q1")$select("NDVI" )$filterDate("2016-01-01","2016-12-31")
```

Finally we perform the aggregation/reduction with `ee_extract_long`.

`ee_extract_long` is a tool that can be used to extract values or zonal statistics over both Images and Image collections. It is a wrapper around `rgee::ee_extract`. `ee_extract_long` uses a couple of server-side processes and client-side regex manipulations to help standardize the output while pivoting `rgee::ee_extract` output from wide to long format. The result is a data.frame ready for processing/plotting.

```{r,eval=F}

median_ndvi<- easyrgee::ee_extract_long(ic = modis_ndvi,
                              sf = dat,
                              sf_col = "ADM1_EN",
                              scale = 250,
                              reducer = "median")
```


Now we can easily use `ggplot` to visualize the results

```{r, fig.width=7}
median_ndvi |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y= value, color=ADM1_EN))+
  geom_line(lwd=1)+
  scale_color_manual(name="State (NGA)" ,values =c("#ee5859","#DBD6C7", "#818183") )+
  theme_minimal()

```


### Identify Start of Rainy Season

Start time of rainy season can have implications on crop harvest which can then impact well-being/livelihoods. Therefore, we have made a function to help identify a date which can be considered start of rainy season.

Lets first look at cumulative rainfall 

Let's load in CHIRPS 2016 daily rainfall data and then use the  `ee_accumulate_band_ic` function to create a cumulative precipitation `ee$ImageCollection` which stores pixel-wise accumulation of values with each consecutive image containing the sum of it's value with all previous `Image`s

```{r}
chirps <-  ee$ImageCollection("UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY")$
  filterDate("2016-01-01","2016-12-31")

precip_cumulative<- easyrgee::ee_accumulate_band_ic(ic = chirps, band = "precipitation")
```


Next we again use `ee_extract_long` to extract the daily median values of 3 different geographic zones 

```{r,eval= F}
median_cumulative_rainfall<- easyrgee::ee_extract_long(ic = precip_cumulative,sf = dat,sf_col = "ADM1_EN",scale = 5000,reducer = "median")
```

use `ggplot` to visualize rainfall accumulation curves by region

```{r, fig.width=7}
median_cumulative_rainfall |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y= value, color=ADM1_EN))+
  geom_line(lwd=1)+
  scale_color_manual(name="State (NGA)" ,values =c("#ee5859","#DBD6C7", "#818183") )+
  theme_minimal()


  
```


From the above plot, let's set 20 mm as a good threshold to use as the start of rainy season

With our threshold we can use `ee_accum_reduce_to_doy` which

1. Creates a cumulative precipitation `ee$ImageCollection` as above 
2. Finds the first day the user-defined threshold was met for each pixel.
3. Returns an `ee$Image` ranging from 0-365 (days of year)


using the chirps 2016 daily rainfall data let's use `ee_accum_reduce_to_doy` to return a day of year (doy) `ee$Image` where the pixel values represent the first day the cumulative rainfall surpassed our set threshold 20 mm


```{r, eval= F,fig.width=7}


precip_threshold_doy<- easyrgee::ee_accum_reduce_to_doy(ic = chirps,thresh = 20,band = "precipitation")
```

We can use `rgee::Map` functions to visualize the image on a leaflet map (in this GitHub README the map is not interactive although it is in the R-session)

```{r, eval= F}

#visualize
Map$setCenter(zoom = 3)
Map$addLayer(precip_threshold_doy,
             visParams = list(min=0, max=365, palette='#9ecae1,#ffffff,#ffeda0,#feb24c,#f03b20'))

```
